<!-- When we want code to be evaluated, but not displayed we use echo = F -->
<!-- By default, R Markdown is evaluated in a fresh R environment, so we have to
load our libraries at the start.  We will also discuss other ways of evaluating 
R Markdown where you can provide an environment -->
```{r, echo = F}

library(data.table)

```

You can very easily load in data and print out the summary

```{r}

data(mtcars)

DT <- as.data.table(mtcars)

DT[, summary(mpg)]

```

You can embed plots or other images
<!-- Notice that below we can hide the printed out results (which is just NULL) 
by specifying results = 'hide' and align the image using fig.align = 'center' -->
```{r, echo = F, results = 'hide', fig.align = 'center'}
DT[, plot(x = hp, 
          y = mpg, 
          main = 'HP vs MPG', 
          xlab = 'Horsepower', 
          ylab = 'Miles Per Gallon')]
```
